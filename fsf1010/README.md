This code presumes the inclusion of the `Point` class (included).

It also presumes a `JSON` file with an `array` called `points` at the top level (included). 

The `JSON` file was generated from the [json Data Example](https://github.com/joswald-khs/example-processing-sketches/blob/main/dataExamples/jsonExample.pde) code.
