There are a couple of examples here a [**CSV**](csvExample.pde) and a [**JSON**](jsonExample.pde) one. They largely do the same thing. 

> [!Note]
> Both of these example programs rely on the `Point` class contained in `Point.pde`. You'll need to add this file to your program as well to get these to work.

> [!Note]
> The data files I generated in class are also present. You'd need to add these files to your project as well if you didn't want to generate your own.
